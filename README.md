# bookbot

Bookbot is a Python program that can analyze an entire book and print out an interesting statistical report.

Here is what Bookbot can do so far: 
* Accept a text file containing a string of words (like a book).
* Parses the file and generates a report containing the amount of words in the document and the amount of times each character is used.
