# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

Bookbot is a Python program that can analyze an entire book, or any other text file, and print out an interesting statistical report.

Here is what Bookbot can do so far: 
* Accept a text file containing a string of words (like a book).
* Parses the file and generates a report containing the amount of words in the document and the amount of times each character is used. 

Usage: 
```
python3 main.py <path_to_book>
```
